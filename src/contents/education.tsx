                <p>Education is key to a bright future. Knowledge has the power to change people for the better, as it inspires them to understand the world that surrounds them, its deep intricacies and almost unexplainable mechanisms. It is through this unequivocal tool that people all around the world find themselves united against the injustices and prejudices, working towards the solution of current and future issues. Unfortunately, education seems to be almost a privilege instead of being globally accessible and enriching. In Mexico, around 4.17 million people do not know how to read or write; 557,308 children do not attend elementary school; 3.62 million youths do not go to secondary and high school; and only 34.9% of young adults attend university (Hernández, 2023).</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>These statistics demonstrate the current education crisis that the country is suffering from, one that is directly related to the lack of environmental awareness and low enrollment on STEM careers. In this way, the team decided to focus its Human Practices activities on education, to slowly but actively contribute to the development of a country where education is so desperately needed. Our main objectives were aimed at scientific dissemination and the promotion of sustainability through accessible and entertaining activities that paved the way to ignite curiosity and awareness in different social groups. Thus, we also include here all the educational material we developed for the activities that were carried out. </p>

                <h2>Science and sustainability workshops in collaboration with USUMA</h2>
                <p>USUMA is an organization dedicated to imparting English and socio-emotional courses to public elementary schools in Mexico. They intend to reduce inequality in marginalized areas and implement bilingual education for fairness of opportunities. Over 300 students from 1st to 6th grade have benefitted from the program (USUMA, 2023). Alongside USUMA, we organized three science and sustainability workshops that were implemented in two different institutions: Manuel Ávila Camacho and José Silverio elementary schools. These workshops took place on the 3rd and 4th of July of 2024, and over 150 students from 8 to 12 years old participated.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>These hands-on workshops were intended to be short and entertaining introductions to synthetic biology, sustainability, and physical properties of matter, that consisted in the following activities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>DNA extraction from bananas:</b> Through this experiment, the students were able to visualize the genetic material that is present in all living organisms, associating it with the Central Dogma and heritage. Additionally, the students comprehended the action of the chemicals utilized in the DNA extraction process. </li>
                  <li><b>Homemade pH indicator:</b> The students determined the pH of different substances through a visual and exciting color change. They also understood the importance of pH in the scientific field, as well as its effects on daily life activities.</li>
                  <li><b>Waste separation competition:</b> Through an exciting competition, the students learnt how to separate waste into their corresponding classification: organic or inorganic. They understood the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and how to contribute to each one of them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After a survey we conducted, we gathered responses that indicated that 100% of the children who participated thought the science workshops were effective in fostering learning about new topics and that 95% of them felt motivated to pursue a career related to science.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>We include the workshops organization and the developed posters for further implementations: </p>

                <h2>Visit to the Santiago River in collaboration with the non-profit organization Un Salto de Vida A.C.</h2>
                <p>The Santiago River originates in Ocotlan, and laterally flows through the metropolitan area of Guadalajara and into the Pacific Ocean. It follows a route of approximately 563 km, and its basin covers 72,427 hectares, which encompasses six states of Mexico: Aguascalientes, Durango, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Nayarit, and Zacatecas. Nowadays, 6.8 million people live near the Santiago River, mainly concentrated in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara. Pollution in the Santiago River arises from human and industrial activities, posing a complex challenge to sustainable development. The understanding of the issue underscores the urgent need for holistic solutions that address the intertwined economic, social, and environmental dimensions of the issue.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>We organized a visit of 15 students to the Santiago River in collaboration with the social organization Un Salto de Vida A.C., that focuses on the protection of the river through social pressure and protests, due to the lack of government actions that could improve the current situation. It also works on forestry programs, diffusion of the problematic, social sensibilization, mental health support, and alliances formation with investigation groups and researchers.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Our objective in organizing the visit was to connect students from Tecnologico de Monterrey, representing diverse backgrounds and fields of study, with the marginalized municipality of El Salto. The community is significantly impacted by government neglect, inadequate environmental regulations, and industrial exploitation. This aimed to raise awareness among participants about the severity of the contamination of the Santiago River and establish a direct dialogue with the people closest to the issue, whose lives are most affected by it. We conducted surveys among the participants before and after the visit, to measure the impact of the activity and know their perspectives regarding water pollution. </p>

                <p>Jeopardy! is a popular trivia game in which participants test their knowledge of a variety of subjects and accumulate points by correctly answering questions with difficulty levels. We carried out a Jeopardy noon at Tecnologico de Monterrey on August 14th, 2024, with students from B.S. in Chemical and Biotechnology Engineering, who had to answer questions about chemistry, molecular biology, sustainability, history, sports and entertainment. We organized this activity to bring together students from different careers and refresh their comprehension of the principles of science, in which collaboration and critical thinking were indispensable skills. </p>

                <p>Art allows people to explore and reflect upon diverse perspectives, fostering empathy, understanding, and appreciation. It plays a significant role in promoting social change and activism by challenging norms, provoking though, and inspiring actions, as artists often use their work to address relevant social and environmental issues, catalyzing dialogue and mobilizing communities to advocate for positive change. Thus, we organized an art competition through social media, where people from all ages were able to submit their work of art and reflect upon water pollution in Mexico. They were able to represent their perspective and emotions in a creative way, while this allowed us to understand their point of view and how aligned they felt about the objective of the project.</p>

                <br></br>
                <p>We organized a visit to Archroma on September 13th, 2024, in Atotonilquillo, Jalisco, where 20 participants from B.S. in Environmental, Chemical and Biotechnology Engineering from Tecnologico de Monterrey and Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Occidente (ITESO) learnt the chemical and safety processes that take place in the enterprise, as well as different unit processes and operations. Archroma also has a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 1,200 m3, running at 96% of it.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The participants comprehended the standard treatment train arrangement, which covered from preliminary treatment to advanced tertiary treatment stages. Additionally, they understood the importance of regulations and how they are applied to industrial water discharge. It was an educational guided visit that served to complement the perspective regarding water pollution in Mexico, thus allowing participants to develop critical thinking when comparing the gained outlook on the Santiago River visit and this tour. We conducted a survey to the participants, where we evaluated their perspectives and comprehension regarding wastewater treatment processes and industrial efforts in water pollution. </p>

                <h2>Educational games in collaboration with Agencia Metropolitana de Bosques Urbanos</h2>
                <p>The Agencia Metropolitana de Bosques Urbanos is an organization dedicated to the administration of parks and urban forests in Guadalajara. They are committed to the dignification and conservation of spaces, as well as the improvement of ecosystems through sustainable and transparent management of public resources or fundraising (AMBU, 2020). </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Alongside them, on September 12th and 20th, we were able to implement modified traditional games in two of the most important parks of the city of Guadalajara: Agua Azul and Metropolitano. We believe that teaching practices should be engaging and easily understandable for everyone. It is essential not only for learners to retain new information but also to forge connections that deepen their understanding of the concepts. When an activity is both enjoyable and fulfilling, participants are more likely to grasp the material effectively. Consequently, we played the following games with the approximately 35 people who were visiting the parks, who were between the ages of 10 to 60 years old and gave them a brief presentation regarding the topic that each game encompassed.</p>
                <br></br>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Memorama:</b> A Memorama game consists of turning around unknown cards and matching corresponding pairs, thus practicing memory and logic. The participants were able to match each SDG with an action that could contribute to its achievement. Most of them did not know about these global objectives and so left the game very satisfied with more understanding of how they could collaborate and protect the environment. </li>
                  <li><b>Protein Translation Dominó:</b> A <i>Dominó</i> is a game where each card is divided in two, with each half typically featuring a number from 1 to 6. Players match identical halves to those on the table, and the first player to run out of cards wins. In this modified version, codons and amino acids replaced the numbers. After a brief introduction, participants learned about the flow of genetic information and the key processes involved, such as replication, transcription, and translation. Then, they matched the corresponding codons with the amino acids they encode, effectively illustrating protein translation in a fun and accessible way.</li>
                  <li><b>SynBingo!:</b> As its name refers to, we created a Bingo that included the main concepts of synthetic biology, such as equipment, technics, microorganisms and the Central Dogma. Through this activity, the players associated the names of each concept with their visual representations that were displayed on the cards, which allowed them to identify the elemental principles of synthetic biology. </li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>
                <p>Here are the games that we created to do this activity, accessible to the whole public! </p>

                <h2>Project exposition with Snakes and Ladders</h2>
                <p>After implementing the scientific games in Agua Azul and Metropolitano parks, we realized we could create a game that encapsulated the core principles of our project: synthetic biology, emerging contaminants, and sustainable development. We modified the traditional Mexican game of Snakes and Ladders, which features a board with colored squares linked to cards containing questions related to our topics. Players roll a die to move forward based on the number rolled, and they must answer a question corresponding to the square they land on. Along the way, players may encounter ladders that help them advance more quickly or snakes that hinder their progress. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>On September 24th, 2024, we introduced this activity following a brief presentation of our project, primarily targeting students in the B.S. in Biotechnology Engineering program. This was an entertaining activity that integrated students from our semester and informed them about the current efforts that we are making to improve the water quality in our country, inspiring them to focus on the synthetic biology field of their careers.</p>

                <h2>Social media engagement: Trivia Mondays</h2>
                <p>As young adults and users of social media, we understand the importance of digital engagement and how impactful it can become. Therefore, we published weekly questions in our Instagram account that were related to molecular biology, SDGs, common technics in a synbio lab, emerging contaminants and water pollution. Through these simple questions and the percentage of correct answers we received, we were able to determine how educated our audience was regarding the displayed topics, thus identifying areas of opportunity and creating further activities based on this.</p>

                <h2>Participation in Podcast “Jóvenes en movimiento” </h2>
                <p>Nowadays, podcasts have become very popular among people from a variety of groups and ages, as almost 70% of the people with a cellphone listen to some kind of podcast (Stanford, 2024). They are tools that allow listeners to engage with content at any time and at any place, while they listen to their preferred topics, discussions, stories, etc. Podcasts can offer unique perspectives and in-depth knowledge and are a perfect form of media that furthers accessible education. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>On July 9th, 2024, we participated in the podcast “Jóvenes en movimiento”, which was played on Radio Sinaloa 94.5 FM. There, Jennifer Jocelyn Rodríguez, the creator of the podcast, interviewed us regarding our project. Our Laboratory and Human Practices team talked about its development, advancements, challenges and justification. It was a very enriching experience where we divulged our efforts and goals, which might have served listeners comprehend current attempts at improving water pollution in Mexico. </p>

                <h2>Women in STEM conference in collaboration with Women for the Future </h2>
                <p>We collaborated with the student group Women for the Future at Tecnológico de Monterrey to host a conference featuring women with master's and/or PhD degrees in scientific fields. They shared their experiences in STEM careers and the daily challenges they face. Currently, only 19% of Mexican women express a desire to pursue a STEM career, largely due to pervasive stereotypes and phrases like “Engineering is not for women.” Furthermore, only 23.7% of university students enrolled in engineering programs are women (Zarco, 2023). </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>These statistics underscore the urgent need to promote STEM careers, empower women, and spark interest in science and mathematics. Women's perspectives are crucial in industrial and research fields, making this event essential for educating the audience about the equality issues we confront and the importance of resilience and knowledge in overcoming them.</p>
